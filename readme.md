## Walkthrough: Integrating Classes, Try-Catch, and Switch-Case for Login Validation

### In this concise walkthrough, we'll explore how classes, try-catch, and switch-case statements are skillfully incorporated to enhance validation for login form.

1. Class-Based Organization:

- LoginValidator Class: Encapsulates validation logic using a switch-case statement. It checks email format and password length.
- ResultDisplay Class: Manages message display with styling based on success or failure.

2. Error Handling:

- Try-catch block surrounds validation, gracefully managing errors. Exceptions are captured, and error messages are presented to users.

3. Logical Decision-Making:

- Switch-case statement within LoginValidator systematically handles various validation scenarios. This clear structure enhances code readability.
  This implementation ensures organized code, user-friendly error handling, and logical validation decisions for a seamless login experience.
